These Key characteristics of cloud computing
1. On-demand self-service: Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.
2. Broad network access: Services are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops).
3. Resource pooling: Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.
4.Rapid elasticity: Resources can be rapidly scaled up or down to accommodate changing user demands, often automatically.
5. Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging metering capabilities, allowing for transparency and accountability in resource consumption.

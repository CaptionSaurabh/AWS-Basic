There are three different service models in cloud computing.
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It includes middleware, development tools, databases, etc.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access applications via a web browser without needing to install or manage the software locally.

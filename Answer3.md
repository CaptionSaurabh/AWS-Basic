What are the deployment models of cloud computing?.....


The deployment models of cloud computing include:
1. Public Cloud: Services are provided over the public internet and are available to anyone who wants to use them. Examples include AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
2. Private Cloud: Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization. It can be managed internally or by a third-party and can be located on-premises or off-premises.
3. Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It offers flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure while leveraging cloud advantages.
4. Community Cloud: Infrastructure is shared among several organizations with similar requirements (e.g., industry-specific regulations, security requirements). It may be managed by the organizations or a third-party provider.
